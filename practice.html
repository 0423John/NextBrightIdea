     Aeromodelling is the activity involving design, development and flying of small air vehicles. It is a very exciting and interesting way to learn, apply and understand science and engineering principles.
		While designing an aeromodel is highly based on engineering principles, flying part of Aeromodelling is also considered to be an expensive hobby/ sport.</font> </h4>

<ul>
<li> <font color="#200E3A"> Is aeromodelling a sport?</li>
<p> Aeromodelling encompasses the design, building and flying of model aircraft, in all their various forms. Once viewed as just a hobby, aeromodelling has become one of the largest and most popular air sports in the world. </p>
<li> What is the purpose of aeromodelling?</li>
<p> “It is a hobby in which a cadet learns to build up the model of actual aircrafts which are unable to carry persons and used for sports purposes”. The aim of introducing Aeromodelling in the NBB curriculum is to increase the air-mindness in the youth of our country. </p>
<li> How is aerodynamics used in sports?</li>
<p> Aerodynamics plays a prominent role in defining the flight of a ball that is struck or thrown through the air in almost all ball sports. The main interest is in the fact that the ball can often deviate from its initial straight path, resulting in a curved, or sometimes an unpredictable, flight path.</p></font>

<h4 class = "text01"style = "text-align:left"><font color="#9DBC98">Aero modelling sport has been around since man first started to put his dreams of air flight into practice. Also known as model aircraft competitions, participants compete with fully functional miniature aircraft that are self-designed and built and controlled by remote. The objective of competitions is to finish a course as fast as possible or achieve maximum flight time, which sometimes involves flying the aircraft for several hours. Aeromodelling generally involves small sized flying objects like Radio Controlled Aircraft (RC Aircraft), Gliders, Ornithopters, Boomerangs and Paper Planes. Although Aeromodelling looks like a lot of Aerospace/ Aeronautical engineering topic, it involves a lot of interdisciplinary concepts from various streams of engineering - primarily aerospace/ Aeronautical, Mechanical, Electronics, Electrical and Computer Science. Aeromodelling gives a good understanding of the roles each of these engineering skills play in real aircraft industry and provides enormous opportunities to develop innovative thinking and implementation.</font>

	<p align="right"> Aero modelling does not fit in the definition of a real sport as it is not a human physical activity, but is included on this list of sports due to similarities to other flying sports.</p> 
	<p align = "right"> The aircraft may resemble scaled down versions of full scale aircraft, while others are uniquely designed. There are also models which resemble flying animals.</p> </font>
	<ul> 
	<font color="#3468C0">
	There are several classifications of model aircraft competitions, which are:
	<li>Outdoor Free Flight - Flights that have no external control after launch. Competitions are conducted outdoors.</li>
    <li>Indoor Free Flight - Free flights that are specially designed for indoor competitions.</li>
	<li>Remote Control (RC) Pylon Racing - Flights used are radio controlled. The competition involves racing on a course that has three pylons arranged to form a triangular course, a quarter mile in length. Races are conduct for a fixed number of laps. The full scale version is Air Racing. </li>
	<li>Remote Control (RC) Soaring - Involves radio controlled flights. There are two types of soaring, slope soaring and thermal soaring.</li>
	<li>Control Line - The aircraft is controlled by the flier by using a pair of lines connected to the aircraft.</li>
	<li>Electric - Involves flying of electric powered model aircraft</li>
